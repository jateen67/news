with the justice department acting to hold him accountable for an unprecedented effort to block the peaceful transfer of presidential power and threaten american democracy the four count indictment the third criminal case against trump provided deeper insight into a dark moment that has already been the subject of exhaustive federal investigations and captivating public hearings it chronicles a months long campaign of lies about the election results and says that even when those falsehoods resulted in a chaotic insurrection at the capitol trump sought to exploit the violence by pointing to it as a reason to further delay the counting of votes that sealed his defeat even in a year of rapid succession legal reckonings for trump tuesdays indictment with charges including conspiring to defraud the united states government that he once led was stunning in its allegations that a former president assaulted the bedrock function of democracy its the first time the defeated president who is the early front runner for next years republican presidential nomination is facing legal consequences for his frantic but ultimately failed effort to cling to power the attack on our nations capitol on jan 6 2021 was an unprecedented assault on the seat of american democracy said justice department special counsel jack smith whose office has spent months investigating trump it was fueled by lies lies by the defendant targeted at obstructing a bedrock function of the us government the nations process of collecting counting and certifying the results of the presidential election the trump campaign called the charges fake and asked why it took two and a half years to bring them trump was the only person charged in tuesdays indictment but prosecutors obliquely referenced a half dozen co conspirators including lawyers inside and outside of government who they said had worked with trump to undo the election results they also advanced legally dubious schemes to enlist slates of fake electors in battleground states won by democrat joe biden to falsely claim that trump had actually won them the indictment accuses the defeated president and his allies of trying to exploit the violence and chaos by calling lawmakers into the evening on jan 6 to delay the certification of bidens victory it also cites handwritten notes from former vice president mike pence that give gravitas to trumps relentless goading to reject the electoral votes pence who is challenging trump for the gop presidential nomination declined overtures from a house panel that investigated the insurrection and sought to avoid testifying before the special counsel he appeared only after losing a court fight with prosecutors learning that trump in one conversation derided him as too honest to stop the certification trump is due in court thursday the first step in a legal process that will play out in a courthouse situated between the white house he once controlled and the capitol his supporters once stormed the case is already being dismissed by the former president and his supporters    and even some of his rivals    as just another politically motivated prosecution yet the case stems from one of the most serious threats to american democracy in modern history the indictment centers on the turbulent two months after the november 2020 election in which trump refused to accept his loss and spread lies that victory was stolen from him the turmoil resulted in the riot at the capitol when trump loyalists violently broke into the building attacked police officers and disrupted the congressional counting of electoral votes in between the election and the riot trump urged local election officials to undo voting results in their states pressured pence to halt the certification of electoral votes and falsely claimed that the election had been stolen    a notion repeatedly rejected by judges among those lies prosecutors say were claims that more than 10000 dead voters had voted in georgia along with tens of thousands of double votes in nevada each claim had been rebutted by courts or state or federal officials the indictment says prosecutors say trump knew his claims of having won the election were false but he repeated and widely disseminated them anyway    to make his knowingly false claims appear legitimate to create an intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger and to erode public faith in the administration of the election the document carefully outlined arguments that trump has been making to defend his conduct that he had every right to challenge the results to use the courts even to lie about it in the process but in stark detail the indictment outlines how the former president instead took criminal steps to reverse the clear verdict voters had rendered the indictment had been expected since trump said in mid july that the justice department had informed him he was a target of its investigation a bipartisan house committee that spent months investigating the run up to the capitol riot also recommended prosecuting trump on charges including aiding an insurrection and obstructing an official proceeding the indictment includes charges of conspiring to defraud the us conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding obstructing an official proceeding and violating a post civil war reconstruction era civil rights statute that makes it a crime to conspire to violate rights that are guaranteed by the constitution    in this case the right to vote the mounting criminal cases are unfolding in the heat of the 2024 race a conviction in this case or any other would not prevent trump from pursuing the white house or serving as president though trump as president could theoretically appoint an attorney general to dismiss the charges or potentially try to pardon himself in new york state prosecutors have charged trump with falsifying business records about a hush money payoff to a porn actor before the 2016 election the trial is set to begin in march in florida the justice department has brought more than three dozen felony counts accusing him of illegally possessing classified documents after leaving the white house and concealing them from investigators that trial begins in may prosecutors in georgia are also investigating efforts by trump and his allies to reverse his election loss to biden there the district attorney of fulton county is expected to announce charging decisions within weeks smiths team has cast a broad net as part of his federal investigation with his team questioning senior trump administration officials including pence before a grand jury in washington prosecutors also interviewed election officials in georgia wisconsin michigan and other battleground states won by biden who were pressured by the trump team to change voting results rudy giuliani a trump lawyer who pursued post election legal challenges spoke voluntarily to prosecutors giuliani was not named in the indictment but appears to match the description of one of the co conspirators a spokesman for giuliani said tuesday night that trump had a good faith basis for the actions he took attorney general merrick garland last year appointed smith an international war crimes prosecutor who also led the justice departments public corruption section as special counsel to investigate efforts to undo the election as well as trumps retention of classified documents at his florida home mar a lago although trump has derided him as deranged and called him politically motivated smiths past experience includes overseeing significant prosecutions against high profile democrats the justice departments investigations began well before smiths appointment proceeding alongside separate criminal probes into the rioters themselves more than 1000 people have been charged in connection with the insurrection including some with seditious conspiracy         \nassociated press writers colleen long zeke

debate the merits of the states new curriculum on african american history less than 24 hours later kamala harris was in an african methodist episcopal church in orlando firing back im here in florida harris said tuesday to a cheering audience at a convention of black women missionaries and i will tell you there is no roundtable no lecture no invitation we will accept to debate an undeniable fact there were no redeeming qualities of slavery it was the latest volley in a rhetorical war over floridas new education standards that has escalated in recent days and it highlights the elevated role that harris has been taking leading the white house charge against republicans vying to face off against president joe biden in the 2024 campaign harriss trip to orlando was her second to florida in just over a week after the state cleared new school guidelines that in part require teachers to instruct middle school students that enslaved people developed skills which in some instances could be applied for their personal benefit its language that desantis defends against strong pushback from democrats and leading black republicans on capitol hill two days after the new guidelines were formally approved harris and her aides quickly organized a trip to the states largest city of jacksonville and denounced extremists who she argued were forcing propaganda on florida schoolchildren the vice president also flew to iowa last week and met with abortion rights advocates as top gop presidential candidates gathered in des moines to address an influential state republican party dinner that came on the heels of a new iowa law that bars most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy which is now on hold blocked by a state judge harriss moves to seize the political offensive are a departure from years past when she found herself under repeated republican attacks after making scant progress on tackling the migration challenges at the us mexico border harris was also the point person on the administrations efforts to bolster voting rights which failed to gain traction on capitol hill her newfound aggressive posture is a natural one harris allies say considering her background as a prosecutor who thrives on zeroing in on an opponent and hammering their faults the vice president has long been an effective messenger when americans fundamental rights are at stake said rohini kosoglu harriss former chief of staff this recent attack on education which most americans would consider extremist is no different nikki fried chairwoman of the florida democratic party said of desantis he took the bait the fact that he doubled down and brought another week of attention to a losing issue for him gives opportunity for the vice president to reinforce the message from the white house and to reinforce what americans understand slavery to have been fried said at issue are floridas revised curriculum standards particularly the mandate on teaching middle school students about the personal benefits of slavery on tuesday harris called it an attempt to gaslight us in an attempt to divide and distract our nation with unnecessary debates she said the invite from desantis    whom she never called out by name    was an effort to legitimize that debate desantis has said his critics are intentionally misinterpreting the language and notes that among the people who worked on the new standards is william b allen a black professor emeritus at michigan state university who has defended the wording about slavery still most of the black republicans in congress have come out against floridas new black history curriculum including south carolina sen tim scott one of desantiss challengers for the gop presidential nomination and rep byron donalds r fla a former ally of the governor who has endorsed former president donald trump rather than backing down the desantis campaign has gone on the attack against critics including donalds whose conservative credentials they question in his letter challenging harris for a debate on the curriculum desantis accused the vice president of trying to score cheap political points and said florida was unique in requiring this level of learning about such an important subject kamala harris got on a jet at taxpayer expense and flew to florida to lie about the african american history standards desantis told foxs bret baier in a monday interview you cant bend the knee to the lefts lies when the left lies and creates these phony narratives youve got to push back theyve been doing this to republicans for years and years after harriss response in orlando on tuesday never back down the super pac supporting desantis tweeted kamala harris announces she is too afraid to meet with ron desantis & the african american history scholars who created the florida curriculum standards she is lying about quisha king a jacksonville mother of two african american girls said she wants an apology from the vice president for spreading what she calls lies about floridas new black history curriculum king said its harris not desantis who is continuing to fuel the controversy adding that she has counted at least four times in recent days that harris has spoken about the florida standards personally i want an apology she should not be doing this said king a black conservative activist who supports desantiss presidential bid its damaging for our kids they hear it and it creates confusion desantis and other republicans are eager to make the 2024 presidential race about harris believing she can be a liability for biden desantiss campaign tags administration as the harris biden administration and the florida governor has been one of a handful of republican challengers who have suggested harris would be the ultimate commander in chief because of bidens advanced age she could end up being president of the united states and i think voters need to take a hard look at that and see if thats something that they would want desantis told cbs news last week adding that i thank her for her rapid response against him and other republicans around the country but democrats say they will continue to bolster her role which will be particularly visible this week as biden remains on vacation in rehoboth beach delaware and harris steps into the spotlight her schedule includes a trip to the critical swing state of wisconsin later this week as well as remarks on the economy after the latest job figures are released on friday shes been such an effective messenger in prosecuting the case against extremist republicans who want to rip away fundamental freedoms attack our rights and gaslight americans because shes got a lifetime of experience of fighting back said jaime harrison chairman of the democratic national committee unfortunately for ron vice president harris stands up to bullies and will always be a staunch defender for the people"

by the coup that won backing tuesday from three other west african nations also ruled by mutinous soldiers about 600 french nationals want to leave along with 400 people of other nationalities from

ordinated the evacuations with the regime that ousted the nations leader but without withdrawing its support for democratically elected president mohamed bazoum diplomatic officials said the ministry cited recent violence that targeted its embassy in niamey the capital as one of the reasons for its decision to offer evacuation flights to its citizens and other europeans spains defence ministry announced preparations to evacuate more than 70 nationals and italy also said it was arranging a flight the evacuations come during a deepening crisis sparked by the coup last week against bazoum his apparent overthrow is a blow for western nations that were working with niger against west african extremists in niamey hotels europeans and other nationalities including some americans packed bags at

envoy for west africa and the sahel leonardo santos simao held out hope that bloodshed could be avoided he said during a virtual news conference tuesday he expects ecowas to go ahead with the deployment of troops to niger if bazoum isnt restored to power but i believe that other efforts are under way so i hope the use of force will not be necessary if everybody talks in good faith and

niger will be considered as a declaration of war against burkina faso and mali the two countries also denounced ecowas economic sanctions as illegal illegitimate and inhumane and refused to apply them ecowas suspended all commercial and financial transactions between its member states and niger as well as freezing nigerien assets held in regional central banks niger relies heavily on foreign aid and sanctions could further impoverish its more than 25 million people mali and burkina faso have each undergone two coups since 2020 as soldiers overthrew governments claiming they could do a better job fighting increasing jihadi violence linked to al qaeda and the islamic state group ecowas has suspended them from the bloc but never threatened to use force guinea another country under military rule since 2021 also issued a statement in support of nigers junta and urged ecowas to come to its senses the evacuations followed violence sunday that targeted the french embassy with protesters burning down a door and smashing windows before the nigerien army dispersed them thousands of pro junta supporters took to niameys streets some waved russian flags along with signs reading down with france and supporting russian president vladimir putin and telling the international community to stay away there has been no clear explanation of the references to russia but some demonstrators regard it as a symbol of anti western feelings some may also reflect support for the russian mercenary group wagners reputation for ruthlessly suppressing militants niger could be following in the same footsteps as mali and burkina faso both of which saw protesters waving russian flags after their coups analysts say nigers coup could also embolden jihadi violence some say boubacar moussa a former member of an al qaeda linked group known as jnim said the military overthrow is exactly what the jihadis want because it will distract and weaken the army jihadis are very supportive of this coup that happened in niger because it will allow them to become very strong he said moussa who spoke to ap in niamey is part of a nationwide program to bring back jihadis reintegrate them into society and use their help in counterterrorism efforts it was spearheaded by bazoum when he was minister of interior and is intended as an alternative to a military solution to stem violence across the country the ap cannot verify that moussa actively fought for jnim if ecowas uses force it could also trigger violence between civilians supporting the coup and those against it niger analysts say nigers prime minister who was appointed by bazoum and was out of the country when the coup took place urged the international community to help roll back the coup in order to defend democracy in west africa for the ecowas countries its a question of survival for the international community too its a question of credibility niger must remain a democratic state prime minister ouhoumoudou mahamadou
