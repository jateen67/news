its communications and says he is in direct contact with them said there will be no dialogue with regional countries until they acknowledge the new head of state nearly three weeks ago mutinous soldiers led by the head of the presidential guard gen abdourahmane tchiani overthrew the west african countrys democratically elected president claiming they could do a better job of securing the nation from growing jihadi violence linked to al qaida and the islamic state group tchiani was declared in charge of the country the west african regional bloc ecowas has threatened to use military force if president mohamed bazoum who took office two years ago is not released and reinstated however the junta has dismissed its warnings and refused most attempts at dialogue there is only one option accepting the regime or war said saidou it is finished for bazoum you must forget about him it is finished it is a waste of time trying to restore him it is not possible he said on thursday ecowas said it had directed the deployment of a standby force to restore democracy in niger after its deadline to reinstate bazoum expired its unclear when or where the force will be deployed but analysts say it could include up to 5000 troops from countries including nigeria benin ivory coast and senegal while the bloc says it wants mediation to prevail multiple attempts by ecowas as well as others have yielded little last week a proposed visit by ecowas the united nations and the african union was rejected on the grounds of evident reasons of security in this atmosphere of menace against niger a day earlier a top us diplomat met some members of the junta but was unable to speak with tchiani or see bazoum many western nations saw niger as one of the last democratic countries in the sahel region the vast expanse south of the sahara desert that they could partner with to beat back the growing jihadi threat hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into providing equipment and training for nigers military by specialized french and us forces all of which could now be used by the junta to tighten its grip on power the military regime is already entrenching itself appointing a new government and stoking anti french sentiment toward its former colonial ruler to shore up its support mercenaries from the russian linked wagner group already operate in a handful of other african countries and are accused of committing human rights abuses earlier this month during a trip to neighboring mali which is also run by a military regime and cooperates with wagner the junta reportedly asked the mercenaries for help days after ecowas order for the standby force to deploy its still unclear what that entails or if theyll invade the african union peace and security council could overrule the decision if it felt that wider peace and security on the continent was threatened by an intervention say analysts the african union is expected to meet monday to discuss nigers crisis some sahel experts say the insistence on force is a cover to spare ecowas from the embarrassment of having made a threat with no real capacity or notion of how to execute it the bloc is acting like a poker player who tried to bluff and when called on it raised the stakes to buy time said peter pham former us special envoy for west africas sahel region and a distinguished fellow at the atlantic council if fighting does ensue the most battle experienced and best equipped militaries in west africa either belong to niger or are sympathetic to it such as mali and burkina faso both countries have opposed the intervention and sent delegations to niger to discuss joint defense efforts aid workers who remained during the start of the coup are evacuating on un run flights to burkina faso several flights left on friday and more are scheduled for saturday according to a foreigner whos leaving on one of the flights and did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation in anticipation of a possible invasion some nigeriens have also moved their families out of the capital but others say theyre not going anywhere and want ecowas to negotiate a peaceful transition of power with the junta what we want to do now is to put things in order and move on  were not expecting ecowas as an african society to come and attack us in this manner its not the best we are not really happy about it said moussa ahmed a food seller in niamey saidou the activist who supports the junta said no matter how ecowas plans to invade be it by land through neighboring benin or nigeria or by air any attack on the palace will result in bazoums death while he didnt confirm a deliberate plan to murder the now ousted president he said that if an invasion began soldiers would kill him there is no one among the soldiers still loyal to bazoum he said he dismissed reports that bazoums conditions under house arrest in his presidential compound were dire and said he had access to medical care if needed and still had his phone a sign that no one wanted to harm him he did not say how he had knowledge of the presidents condition saidou said he was being kept for his own security and the only way for bazoum to be released was for ecowas to accept that his time in office was finished those close to the president however paint a much starker picture since the july 26 coup bazoums been confined with his wife and son to the basement of his presidential compound which is surrounded by guards and is now cut off from resupplies of food electricity water and cooking gas

        "text": " an investigation has been launched into the death of a pakistani porter near the peak of the worlds most treacherous mountain a pakistani mountaineer said saturday following allegations that dozens of climbers eager to reach the summit had walked past the man after he was gravely injured in a fall the accusations surrounding events on july 27 on k2 the worlds second highest peak overshadowed a record established by norwegian climber kristin harila and her sherpa guide tenjin by climbing k2 that day they became the worlds fastest climbers scaling the worlds 14 highest mountains in 92 days harila rejected any responsibility for the death of the porter mohammed hassan a 27 year old father of three who slipped and fell off a narrow trail in a particularly dangerous area of k2 known as the bottleneck in an instagram post friday she wrote that she felt angry at how many people have been blaming others for this tragic death and that no one was at fault harila was defending herself against allegations from two other climbers who were on k2 that day austrian wilhelm steindl and german philip flaemig the pair had aborted their climb because of difficult weather conditions but said they reconstructed the events later by reviewing drone footage the footage showed dozens of climbers passing a gravely injured hassan instead of coming to his rescue steindl told the associated press on saturday he alleged that the porter could have been saved if the other climbers including harila and her team had given up attempts to reach the summit steindl added that the footage shows a man trying to rub hassans chest trying to keep him warm to keep him alive somehow you can see that the man is desperate we know by now that this was his friend also a pakistani high altitude porter steindl told ap and what you also see in the drone footage is a line of 70 climbers marching towards the summit there is a double standard here if i or any other westerner had been lying there everything would have been done to save them steindl said everyone would have had to turn back to bring the injured person back down to the valley steindl also said that july 27 was the only day in this season on which conditions were good enough for mountaineers to reach the summit of k2 which explains why there were so many climbers who were so eager to get to the top i dont want to kind of directly blame anybody steindl said im just saying there was no rescue operation initiated and thats really very very tragic because thats actually the most normal thing one would do in a situation like that harila told sky news that hassan had been dangling from a rope head down after his fall at the bottleneck which she described as probably the most dangerous part of k2 she said that after about an hour her team was able to pull him back onto the trail at some point she and another person from her team decided to continue to the top while another team member stayed with hassan giving him warm water and oxygen from his own mask the climber said harila said she decided to continue moving toward the summit because her forward fixing team also ran into difficulties which she did not further detail in the interview asked about hassans gear harila said that he did not wear a down suit and he didnt have gloves nor did he have oxygen we didnt see any sign of either a mask or oxygen tank she said meanwhile an investigation has been launched into hassans death said karrar haidri the secretary of the pakistan alpine club a sports organization that also serves as the governing body for mountaineering in pakistan the investigation is being conducted by officials in the gilgit baltistan region which has jurisdiction over k2 said haidri anwar syed the head of lela peak expedition the company handling harilas expedition said hassan died about 150 meters 490 feet below the summit he said several people tried to help providing oxygen and warmth to no avail syed said that because of the bottlenecks dangerous conditions it would not be possible to retrieve hassans body and hand it to the family he said his company gave money to hassans family and would continue to help but did not elaborate asked about hassans apparent lack of equipment syed said the expedition company pays money to porters to buy gear and that hassan was paid the agreed upon amount steindls fellow climber flaemig alleged in an interview with the austrian newspaper der standard that hassan had no high altitude experience he wasnt equipped properly he did not have experience he was a base camp porter and for the first time was picked to be a high altitude porter he wasnt qualified for this he said steindl visited hassans family and set up a crowd funding campaign after three days donations reached more than 114000 euros us$125000 saturday i saw the suffering of the family steindl told ap the widow told me that her husband did all this so that his children would have a chance in life so that they could go to school\n      \ngrieshaber reported from berlin"

        "text": " after nearly three weeks of appealing to the united states and other allies for help restoring nigers president to power friends and supporters of the democratically elected leader are making a simpler plea save his life president mohamed bazoum leader of the last remaining western allied democracy across a vast stretch of africas sahara and sahel sits confined with his family in an unlit basement of his presidential compound cut off from resupplies of food and from electricity and cooking gas by the junta that overthrew him nigers ambassador to the united states told the associated press they are killing him said the ambassador mamadou kiari liman tinguiri a close associate who maintains daily calls with the detained leader the two have been colleagues for three decades since the now 63 year old president was a young philosophy instructor a teachers union leader and a democracy advocate noted for his eloquence the plan of the head of the junta is to starve him to death liman tinguiri told the ap in one of his first interviews since mutinous troops allegedly cut off food deliveries to the president his wife and his 20 year old son almost a week ago this is inhuman and the world should not tolerate that the ambassador said it cannot be tolerated in 2023 on saturday the presidents captors allowed a doctor to visit the family for the first time and brought some food a presidential adviser told the ap the adviser who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity declined to give details bazoum sits in the dark basement the ambassador said he answers the phone when a call comes in that he knows to be his friend or someone else he wants to speak to the beleaguered president and his ambassador whom junta members have declared out of a job talk one or more times a day bazoum has not been seen out in public since july 26 when military vehicles blocked the gates to the presidential palace and security forces announced they were taking power it is not possible to independently determine the presidents circumstances the united states united nations and others have expressed repeated concern for what they called bazoums deteriorating conditions in detention and warned the junta they would hold it responsible for the well being of bazoum and his family separately human rights watch said friday it had spoken directly to the detained president and to others in his circle and received some similar accounts of mistreatment however an activist who supports nigers new military rulers in its communications said the reports of the presidents dire state were false insa garba saidou said he was in contact with some junta members but did not say how he had knowledge of the presidents lot bazoum was lucky he was not taken anywhere saidou said he was left in his palace with his phone those who did that dont intend to hurt bazoum nigers military coup and the plight of its ousted leader have drawn global attention    but not because that kind of turmoil is unusual for west africa niger alone has had about a half dozen military takeovers since independence in 1960 niger leaders have suffered in coups before most notably when a military installed leader was shot down in 1999 by the same presidential guard unit that instigated the current coup nigers return to reflexive armed takeovers by disgruntled troops is reverberating in the us and internationally for two key reasons one is because bazoum came to power in a rare democratic presidential election in the africas unstable sahara and sahel in the only peaceful democratic transfer of power that niger has managed the united states alone has invested close to us$1 billion in niger in recent years to support its democracy and deliver aid in addition to building national forces capable of holding off north and west africas al qaida  and islamic state allied armed groups the us backed counterterror presence is the second key reason that nigers coup is resonating americans have a 1100 strong security presence and have built bases in nigers capital and far north into its main outposts to counter west africas armed jihadist groups the biden administration has yet to call what has happened in niger a coup citing laws that would obligate the us to cut many of its military partnerships with the country nigers region is dominated by military or military aligned governments and a growing number of them have entered security partnerships with russias wagner mercenary groups the soldiers who ousted bazoum have announced a ruling structure but said little publicly about their plans us under secretary of state victoria nuland met with nigers junta members in the capital this week but called them unreceptive to her demands to restore nigers democracy they were quite firm about how they want to proceed and it is not in support of the constitution of niger nuland told reporters after the junta also told nuland that bazoum would die if the regional ecowas security bloc intervened militarily to restore democracy us officials told the ap late this week the ambassador shrugged that threat off saying the junta is already on track to kill bazoum by trapping his family and him with little more than a shrinking supply of dried rice and no means to cook it secretary of state antony blinken has spoken several times with the detained president and expressed concern for his and his familys safety the us says it has cut some aid to the government and paused military cooperation blinken has expressed broad support for ecowas whose diplomatic efforts have been spurned by the niger junta and which has warned of military force as a last resort blinken said in a statement friday he was particularly dismayed that nigers mutinous soldiers had refused to release bazoums family as a goodwill gesture he gave no details while the junta adviser saidou denied that the junta threatened to kill bazoum if ecowas invaded he said bazoums death would be inevitable if that happened even if the high officers of the junta wont touch bazoum if one gun is shot at one of nigers borders in order to reinstate bazoum im sure that there will be soldiers who will put an end to his life he said bazoum told human rights watch that family members and friends who brought food were being turned away and that the junta had refused treatment for his young son who has a heart condition bazoum and his undetained allies want regional partners the us and others to intervene with bazoum vulnerable in captivity neither he nor the ambassadors specify what they want the us and other allies to do bazoum is a member of nigers tiny minority of nomadic arabs in a country of varying cultures rich in tradition despite his political career bazoum has retained his peoples devotion to livestock keeping camels that he dotes on liman tinguiri said for all his deprivations the ambassador said bazoum remains in good spirits he is a man who is mentally very strong he said hes a man of faith\n      \nassociated press writer sam mednick contributed from niamey niger"
