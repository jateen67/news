in pakistankristin harila 37 set a world record when she completed the k2 climb on july 27 becoming the fastest person to scale all 14 of the world\u2019s tallest mountains with an elevation over 8000 metresshe completed the feat alongside her nepali sherpa tenjen lama sherpa in just three months and one day breaking the previous record held by nepali british mountaineer nirmal purja who took six months and six daysbut harila\u2019s critics are saying she will be remembered not for her record breaking accomplishment but for her inhumanity after her team failed to save 27 year old mohammed hassan from dying on k2 meanwhile the norwegian climber says the dangerous conditions that day forced her team to split upthe footage that sparked the scandal was released by austrian climbing duo wilhelm steindl and philip fl\u00e4mig who were also on k2 that day they were recording drone footage when they captured video of multiple climbers walking over hassan\u2019s body to continue their summitfl\u00e4mig described what they captured to austria\u2019s standard newspaper \u201che is being treated by one person while everyone else is pushing towards the summit the fact is that there was no organized rescue operation although there were sherpas and mountain guides on site who could have taken action\u201dfl\u00e4mig and steindl were far below \u201cthe bottleneck\u201d of k2 where hassan died when they filmed the drone footage\u201cif he had been a westerner he would have been rescued immediately\u201d steindl said \u201cno one felt responsible for him what happened there is a disgrace a living human was left lying so that records could be set\u201d\u201che was treated like a second class human being\u201d he addedaccording to steindl who spoke with hassan\u2019s family after descending k2 hassan took the job of rope fixer to pay for his diabetic mother\u2019s medical expenses despite his lack of mountaineering experience rope fixers or fixing teams climb ahead to fix bolted ropes in place to assist climbers the practice is quite dangerous but makes climbing easier and safer for the mountaineers belowhassan who leaves behind a wife and three children was climbing with the group just in front of harila\u2019s team when the accident happened according to a post on harila\u2019s website in the statement the norwegian climber insists she and her team did everything they could to save the sherpa but were unable to rescue him because of the dangerous conditionsa post shared by kristin harila @kristinharila\u201ci did not see exactly what took place but suddenly hassan had fallen and was hanging on the rope between 2 ice anchors\u201d harila wrote\u201cat first nobody moved probably out of shock and fear then we realised that he was hanging upside down and was not able to climb up by himself he must have fallen almost 5 meters and his harness was all the way down around his knees\u201d harila said noting that hassan didn\u2019t even have a down jacket or gloves on for the cold and treacherous climb up k2when they managed to reach hassan she says they gave him oxygen from their tanks and hot water to warm him up\u201cas we were trying to move hassan up closer to the path an avalanche went off around the corner where the fixing team was\u201d harila said \u201cworried for the safety of the fixing team lama and myself went forward to see how we could help them\u201dmeanwhile the cameraman in harila\u2019s team stayed behind to help hassanwhen harila and lama reached the fixing team they asked the sherpas if they were going to head back down the mountain\u201cthey said yes and as we understood it that meant there was more help going to hassan we decided to continue forward as too many people in the bottleneck would make it more dangerous for a rescue\u201d harila writes\u201cconsidering the amount of people that stayed behind and that had turned around i believed hassan would be getting all the help he could and that he would be able to get down we did not fully understand the gravity of everything that happened until later\u201deventually harila\u2019s cameraman left hassan\u2019s side because he had run out of oxygen himselfafter harila\u2019s team summited k2 and were climbing back down they found hassan dead she said it would have been too dangerous for her team to bring hassan\u2019s body safely down the mountain\u201cyou need 6 people to carry a person down especially in dangerous areas however the bottleneck is so narrow that you can only fit one person in front and one behind the person being helped in this case it was impossible to safely carry hassan down\u201d she writesshe described hassan\u2019s death as a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and writes that she is angry that people are being blamed for his death\u201cthis was no one\u2019s fault you cannot comment when you do not understand the situation\u201dshe added that hassan was unprepared for the dangerous trek\u201ceveryone that goes up a summit needs proper training proper equipment and proper guidance from what i understood hassan was not properly equipped to take on an 8000m summit what happened is in no way his fault but it shows the importance of taking all of the possible precautions so that we can help ourselves and others\u201d she stateda gofundme for hassan\u2019s family was started by austrian climber steindl who wrote that the family now has no source of income in the wake of hassan\u2019s death the campaign has raised over 100000 euros on friday just shy of the target of 110000 eurosthe money will go directly to hassan\u2019s family the message on the donation page states ensuring his children have access to educationin an update posted wednesday steindl thanked donors for their money and wrote \u201ctogether we save the livelihood of a family abandoned by western mountaineers let\u2019s show them we\u2019re better than that\u201dk2 is widely considered one of the most difficult mountains to summit in the world even harder than everest where more of the mountain flattens off giving respite to climbers"

line so that they will start mounting meaningful pressure substantial pressure on their partners to start delivering on time\u201d luk\u00e1cs said calling canada\u2019s 2019 passenger protection regulations \u201claughable\u201dthis month his organization the public interest advocacy centre and university of ottawa associate law professor marina pavlovi\u0107 submitted recommendations to the

for a single violation to an airline and that\u2019s where the problem starts\u201d he explained\u201cthere is no appetite no courage no determination to actually start issuing hefty fines to airlines it\u2019s really a vicious circle because airlines have this sense of safety \u2026 they act in a particular way that generates a lot of complaints those complaints overwhelm the system\u201djohn
