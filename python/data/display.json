        "text":"a norwegian mountaineer is defending her actions in the face of backlash surrounding drone footage that appears to show her team climbing over a dying sherpa to reach the summit of k2 in pakistankristin harila 37 set a world record when she completed the k2 climb on july 27 becoming the fastest person to scale all 14 of the world’s tallest mountains with an elevation over 8000 metresshe completed the feat alongside her nepali sherpa tenjen lama sherpa in just three months and one day breaking the previous record held by nepali british mountaineer nirmal purja who took six months and six daysbut harila’s critics are saying she will be remembered not for her record breaking accomplishment but for her inhumanity after her team failed to save 27 year old mohammed hassan from dying on k2 meanwhile the norwegian climber says the dangerous conditions that day forced her team to split upthe footage that sparked the scandal was released by austrian climbing duo wilhelm steindl and philip flämig who were also on k2 that day they were recording drone footage when they captured video of multiple climbers walking over hassan’s body to continue their summitflämig described what they captured to austria’s standard newspaper “he is being treated by one person while everyone else is pushing towards the summit the fact is that there was no organized rescue operation although there were sherpas and mountain guides on site who could have taken action”flämig and steindl were far below “the bottleneck” of k2 where hassan died when they filmed the drone footage“if he had been a westerner he would have been rescued immediately” steindl said “no one felt responsible for him what happened there is a disgrace a living human was left lying so that records could be set”“he was treated like a second class human being” he addedaccording to steindl who spoke with hassan’s family after descending k2 hassan took the job of rope fixer to pay for his diabetic mother’s medical expenses despite his lack of mountaineering experience rope fixers or fixing teams climb ahead to fix bolted ropes in place to assist climbers the practice is quite dangerous but makes climbing easier and safer for the mountaineers belowhassan who leaves behind a wife and three children was climbing with the group just in front of harila’s team when the accident happened according to a post on harila’s website in the statement the norwegian climber insists she and her team did everything they could to save the sherpa but were unable to rescue him because of the dangerous conditionsa post shared by kristin harila @kristinharila“i did not see exactly what took place but suddenly hassan had fallen and was hanging on the rope between 2 ice anchors” harila wrote“at first nobody moved probably out of shock and fear then we realised that he was hanging upside down and was not able to climb up by himself he must have fallen almost 5 meters and his harness was all the way down around his knees” harila said noting that hassan didn’t even have a down jacket or gloves on for the cold and treacherous climb up k2when they managed to reach hassan she says they gave him oxygen from their tanks and hot water to warm him up“as we were trying to move hassan up closer to the path an avalanche went off around the corner where the fixing team was” harila said “worried for the safety of the fixing team lama and myself went forward to see how we could help them”meanwhile the cameraman in harila’s team stayed behind to help hassanwhen harila and lama reached the fixing team they asked the sherpas if they were going to head back down the mountain“they said yes and as we understood it that meant there was more help going to hassan we decided to continue forward as too many people in the bottleneck would make it more dangerous for a rescue” harila writes“considering the amount of people that stayed behind and that had turned around i believed hassan would be getting all the help he could and that he would be able to get down we did not fully understand the gravity of everything that happened until later”eventually harila’s cameraman left hassan’s side because he had run out of oxygen himselfafter harila’s team summited k2 and were climbing back down they found hassan dead she said it would have been too dangerous for her team to bring hassan’s body safely down the mountain“you need 6 people to carry a person down especially in dangerous areas however the bottleneck is so narrow that you can only fit one person in front and one behind the person being helped in this case it was impossible to safely carry hassan down” she writesshe described hassan’s death as a “tragic accident” and writes that she is angry that people are being blamed for his death“this was no one’s fault you cannot comment when you do not understand the situation”she added that hassan was unprepared for the dangerous trek“everyone that goes up a summit needs proper training proper equipment and proper guidance from what i understood hassan was not properly equipped to take on an 8000m summit what happened is in no way his fault but it shows the importance of taking all of the possible precautions so that we can help ourselves and others” she stateda gofundme for hassan’s family was started by austrian climber steindl who wrote that the family now has no source of income in the wake of hassan’s death the campaign has raised over 100000 euros on friday just shy of the target of 110000 eurosthe money will go directly to hassan’s family the message on the donation page states ensuring his children have access to educationin an update posted wednesday steindl thanked donors for their money and wrote “together we save the livelihood of a family abandoned by western mountaineers let’s show them we’re better than that”k2 is widely considered one of the most difficult mountains to summit in the world even harder than everest where more of the mountain flattens off giving respite to climbers",

travel flights at near full capacity and air traffic control staffing shortages that have led to cancellations and delaysit also pointed the finger at weather“the weather this summer has been unusual particularly in the us where we are the foreign carrier that operates the most flights so we are more affected than other canadian airlines” wrote a member of the media relations team“to give you an idea in july 2023 we had 26 days of significant weather events that disrupted our operation compared to 19 in july 2019”air canada said it understands delays are “disappointing” and does its best to avoid themwestjet also declined an interview and sent an emailed statement citing weather and third party delays“while the saying remains true that we cannot control the weather westjet continues to advocate for a service framework of shared accountability across all entities that contribute to canada’s vital aviation ecosystem” wrote media relations strategist madison kruger“we believe the best path forward is one that holds all entities in the ecosystem to the same standard that airlines are held to”global news has reached out to transport canada for comment on this storyin april the federal liberals tabled legislation that would increase the maximum fine for air passenger protection regulations violations tenfold to $250000 and place the regulatory cost of complaints on carriers’ shoulders it further demands airlines institute a process to deal with claims and respond to complaints with a decision within 30 days and closes of a loophole that has allowed airlines to avoid compensating passengers for delayed luggage though not for lost luggagethe public consultation process on regulations for the proposed amendments closed thursdaygábor lukács president of the air passenger rights advocacy group said flight timeliness is a “complex problem” as airlines do rely on contractors and subcontractors in order to operate both a “carrot and a stick” are needed to improve performance he added“ultimately airlines have to face consequences at the bottom line so that they will start mounting meaningful pressure substantial pressure on their partners to start delivering on time” lukács said calling canada’s 2019 passenger protection regulations “laughable”this month his organization the public interest advocacy centre and university of ottawa associate law professor marina pavlović submitted recommendations to the canadian transportation agency cta for improving those regulations by bringing them in line with europe’sthat means narrowing the standard of “extraordinary circumstances” to exclude crew shortages maintenance or safety issues “short of terrorism or recalls of actual fleet equipment” carrier labour disruptions known airport or operational issues and omissions of staff and third party contractorsthe group also recommended tightening the refund deadline from 30 days to seven and implementing single rules for entitlement to a refund meals and accommodations regardless of the cause of flight disruption and how much advance notice was givenin an emailed statement the cta confirmed it had received the report“we will be carefully considering all of the input received during this consultation period before publishing draft amended regulations in the fall” wrote terry kuny of the cta media team“following this publication there will be another consultation period within which we will also welcome submissions from interested stakeholders”lukács recognized the more ambitious federal regulations currently on the table for passenger protection but questioned how much they would be used once in effect given reticence to award fines at the current maximum“i’m not aware of any case where a maximum $25000 fine was issued for a single violation to an airline and that’s where the problem starts” he explained“there is no appetite no courage no determination to actually start issuing hefty fines to airlines it’s really a vicious circle because airlines have this sense of safety … they act in a particular way that generates a lot of complaints those complaints overwhelm the system”john gradek a lecturer at mcgill university’s school of continuing studies for aerospace and aviation said poor canadian airline performance is not a “new phenomenon” as companies struggle to recover from a pandemic crash in profits“air canada has had some problems in terms of making sure its operational capabilities match the flight schedules that they put in the marketplace” he told global news“really it is not part of their primary objective to keep on time performance as a key driver of performance for the summer”both air canada and westjet said they had implemented measures to reduce the impact of delaysair canada’s include schedule adjustments during traffic peaks and partnerships with other carriers for “additional lift” such as pal in eastern canada and omni for manchester flightswestjet said it has

peak of the worlds most treacherous mountain and died there after several hours the circumstances of mohammad hassans july 27 death on k2 the worlds second highest peak sparked ongoing controversy with two climbers arguing that he could have been saved if all those on the mountain that day had aborted their climb and focused on getting him down safely the fallout from hassans death overshadowed a record established by norwegian climber kristin harila and her sherpa guide tenjin by climbing k2 that day they became the worlds fastest climbers scaling the worlds 14 highest mountains in 92 days harila told the associated press on sunday that in the snowy condition we had up there that day it wouldnt be possible to carry him down im sure that if it was possible that we saw a chance to carry him down from there everyone would have tried that she said by zoom from norway but it was impossible the uproar had been sparked by drone footage showing dozens of climbers pushing past a gravely injured hassan toward the summit the path to the peak was crowded on july 27 described as the last day of the season for a possible ascent in pakistan local authorities in the gilgit baltistan region which has jurisdiction over k2 formed a five member committee on aug 7 to investigate hassans death the committees mandate noted that its crucial to determine the facts after distressing reports circulating on various social media platforms investigators will try to determine among other things whether more could have been done to save hassan said sajid hussain deputy director of the sports and tourism department of gilgit baltistan he told the ap on sunday that investigators are to submit their findings on aug 22 hassan a 27 year old father of three was hired by the pakistan based expedition company lela peak and was assigned to a team of russian climbers said company director anwar syed asked if she felt the controversy had tainted her record harila said of course but did not elaborate she appeared distraught at times during the interview and said she had received death threats we tried for hours to save him and we were on probably the most dangerous area of k2 she said adding that she and her teammates were taking a very very big risk harila said hassan slipped and fell off the narrow path around 215 am on july 27 dangling on a rope upside down at the time hassan had been second in the line of climbers harila said she was eighth and her team members were in 7th and 9th place respectively as they tried to pull hassan onto the path an avalanche came down near where her forward fixing team was after 90 minutes of attending to hassan harila and a teammate moved in the direction of the summit to check on the fixing team while her cameraman gabriel stayed behind with hassan she said gabriel shared his oxygen with hassan gave him warm water and tried to warm him she said gabriel stayed with the porter for 25 hours but started running out of oxygen gabriel then moved toward the peak to meet up with harilas sherpas who had extra oxygen tanks at that time there were also others attending to hassan she said when gabriel arrived at the peak harila asked him how hassan was doing she said gabriel told her that he was in very bad shape on the way back down she saw hassans dead body lying on the path harila rejected claims made by austrian climber wilhelm steindl that more would have been done if a westerner had been hurt on the mountain steindl and german climber philip flaemig who shot the drone footage had abandoned their k2 climb earlier that day because of bad weather we did really try to save him and we would have done just the same if it was me or anyone else that was hanging upside down there she said we couldnt have done anything more harila said hassan didnt seem to have proper gear or training as a high altitude porter and that it appeared to have been his first ascent it was a very tragic accident that happened on k2 that day harila said and we feel so sorry for hassan himself and for his family his wife and his kids and his mother hussain the regional official said investigators would look at the porters gear and training they will also review weather conditions on july 27 including avalanches and examine the actions of the expedition company that employed hassan the investigators are questioning porters and sherpa guides he said though it was not clear if foreign climbers would be interviewed as well the team has collected relevant documents from government departments and private companies involved in k2 ascent hussain said the investigators were also visiting the k2 base camp and other relevant locations steindl told the ap on saturday that he felt more could have been done to save hassan everyone would have had to turn back to bring the injured person back down to the valley i dont want to kind of directly blame anybody steindl said im just saying there was no rescue operation initiated and thats really very very tragic because thats actually the most normal thing one would do in a situation like that in hassans home village of tisar friends and neighbors visited the family offering prayers of condolence a childhood friend basharat hussain said hassan had been determined to provide opportunities for his children that he never had including an education i think this is the most dehumanizing event in my life he said adding that he hopes it will not happen in the future steindl visited hassans family and set up a crowd funding campaign after four days donations reached more than 125000 euros just over $137000      associated press journalist zarar khan contributed to this story from islamabad pakistan",
