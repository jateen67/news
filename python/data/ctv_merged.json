the us as this months president of the un security council is preparing to put forward a resolution to authorize a mission in haiti led by kenyan police who have relatively little overseas experience in such large numbers and dont speak french which is used in haiti this is not a traditional peacekeeping force the us ambassador to the un linda thomas greenfield said tuesday for more than nine months the un had appealed unsuccessfully for a country to lead an effort to restore order to the poorest nation in the western hemisphere kenyas interest was announced on saturday with its foreign minister saying his government has accepted to positively consider leading a force in haiti and sending 1000 police officers to train the haitian national police restore normalcy and protect strategic

thousands of personnel in un peacekeeping missions kenya has less than 450 according to un data just 32 are police officers the us has a total of 35 personnel in un peacekeeping missions i have no knowledge of any complaints raised by the un during those deployments hence no concern on my end the executive director of the watchdog independent medico legal unit peter kiama told the ap remember the major challenges regarding policing practices in kenya include political interference with police command and independence inadequate political will to reform the institution culture of internal impunity and criminality and inadequate internal and external accountability with the haiti deployment kenyan police would likely be in charge instead of answering to a un force commander as in
